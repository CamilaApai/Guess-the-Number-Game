# Overview

This project aims to develop a simple guessing game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The software serves as an example of a Java game, highlighting integration with Visual Studio Code and GitHub.

The primary goal is to provide an interactive experience for the user, allowing them to engage in the challenge of guessing a number between 1 and 100. The software provides feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target number.
